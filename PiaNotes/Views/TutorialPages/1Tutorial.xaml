                <TextBlock>When playing a song you will have to play at a certain speed, we call this speed the tempo. The tempo can be different for all kind of songs.</TextBlock>
                <TextBlock>For convenience, PiaNotes will set the original tempo of the song automatically. A song consists of different bars of the tempo.</TextBlock>
                <TextBlock>Other than that, there are also a few beats in a bar. 4/4, the first 4 stands for the amount of notes in a bar,</TextBlock>
                <TextBlock>whereas the second 4 stands for the kind of notes that will be played. With the 4/4 there are 4 quarter notes per bar, while the 6/8 consists of 6 8th notes per bar.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock>For the following exercises there will be notes you have to play in a certain tempo.</TextBlock>
                <TextBlock>For convenience, there will not be any different kinds of notes or bars as of now. We will focus more on those topics after this exercise.</TextBlock>
